this is a implementation of aprior algorithm.

Evironment:
    Python 3.x, and Python2.x is not supported

How to run:
    The command should be excuted in terminal and should have the format below:
        'python3 aprior.py fullfilepath Minsup Minconf'
    where fullfilepath is the full path of the dataset file; Minsup is the minimal support( an integer), and Minconf is the Minimal Confidence(should be a decimal)

    Here is an example, you can run this in the current folder:
        python3 aprior.py data/dataset_full.txt 300 0.41

Input :
    the input dataset should have format as data/example.txt

Result:
    The result will be saved in outputs/
    The excuted time will printed in the terminal
